<p>SCC: The straw that stirs the drink</p>
<p>The dollar value that future populations and governments around the
world would be willing to pay to avoid experiencing climate change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you could see dimly into the future—which you can!—and calculate in dollars the benefits of actions preventing utter destruction and chaos, what would you call this price?
You might call it “the alpha price,” the price of having a safe future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The s̶o̶c̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶c̶o̶s̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶b̶o̶n̶ alpha price is a regulatory tool (yawn) that addresses an important disparity, which is the difference between market prices for fossil fuels and the value of the damage they inflict on the world. By calculating the alpha price…
and using it as a “benefit” in cost-benefit analyses, government can make sure that they truly understand the costs and benefits of new policies. They ensure that demonstrably incorrect market prices for fossil fuels are not obscuring the real benefits of action.
t’s a complicated thing, calculating the alpha price, which brings us to the question of how bureaucratic inertia and professional conventions perpetuate thinking we don’t need anymore.
Hold your breath, we’re free-diving now deep into the bowels of regulatory bureaucracy.
Which brings us to the punchline: Is there a better way to bring about a net-zero, safe future without even relying on an alpha price? Is applying a cost-benefit analysis to climate change itself a part of the bureaucratic and professional conventions that are holding back climate progress? Maybe! That’s why(I think!) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noahqk" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>noahqk?</strong></a>)</span> et al have given us Near-Term to Net-Zero and (I think) why <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-GernotWagner" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>GernotWagner?</strong></a>)</span>

<ul>
<li>The social cost of carbon (SCC) is the cost to society of polluting an additional ton of CO2.
The SCC enables regulators to account for potential benefits to society through lower carbon
emissions and also points towards the optimal price on carbon required to address excess
greenhouse gas emissions. The US government SCC was approximately $50 per ton of CO2
as of 2016, using a discount rate of 3%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its inception, the SCC has been used in roughly 150 federal regulations that cover energy
efficiency, forest conservation, fuel-economy standards, and emissions performance standards.
Indeed, in many cases the SCC was instrumental in passing these regulations, offering relevant
agencies a reliable, transparent tool to calculate the full benefits the new rules would offer to
society. All told, a recent paper calculated, federal regulations written to include the SCC in the
US have more than $1 trillion of benefits.</p>
<p>When one considers the possibility of larger-than-
expected temperature changes for a given change in emissions, sea level rise in short time
periods, physical “tipping points,” and human responses like mass migration, then the case for a
low discount rate appears strong.</p>
<p>The broader point is that global
interest rates have declined since the SCC was set and, even setting aside the risk characteristics
of payoffs from climate mitigation investments, there is a solid case that the discount rates
currently used to calculate the SCC may be too high.</p>
<p>When the US accounts for the full global benefits of reducing
our emissions, this incentivizes reciprocal climate policies in other countries, like China and
India, that reduces their emissions which benefits the US.</p>
<p>The use of a SCC that only
considers domestic benefits is very likely to deprive the United States of emissions reductions in
the United States that would protect us from more virulent climate change</p>
<p>Climate Impact Lab (CIL) aims to produce the
world’s first empirically derived estimate of the social cost of carbon</p>
<p>CIL’s core findings to date have been in the mortality sector. Climate change has a demonstrable
impact on mortality rates, as extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, affect health outcomes
such as heat stroke and cardiovascular disease. Using data from forty countries and statistical
methods to account for the benefits and costs of adaptation, we estimate the full mortality risk
due to climate change to be an additional 85 deaths per 100,000 in 2100.
This increase in the global mortality rate is more than the mortality rate associated with
all infectious diseases in 2018.</p>
<p>The elevated mortality risk equates to a monetary cost of $23.6
per metric ton of carbon emitted today when using the same assumptions that underlie the
Obama SCC calculation. In other words, we estimate the partial social cost of carbon,
accounting for costs to human mortality alone, to be at least $23.6 per ton.</p>
<p>The Obama administration’s estimate of the SCC assumed that society is
risk neutral, that is, we are not willing to pay a premium to avoid uncertainty. If the more
realistic assumption that society is risk averse were introduced, then the estimated SCC would be
higher, likely substantially so, than the $50 per metric ton of CO 2 discussed in the previous
section. Similarly, there is a good case for scaling the damages from the CIL’s research upwards
to reflect the risk aversion that characterizes individuals’ choices in their own lives.</p>
<p>While Accra, Ghana will see an increase in the full mortality
risk of 160 per 100,000 due to climate change in 2100, Oslo, Norway will experience a decline in
the full mortality risk of 230 per 100,000 due to warmer winters.
Climate change
will leave some regions as winners and others as losers both around the globe and within the
United States.</p>
<p>Climate impacts vary considerably
across locations. While northern latitudes will experience net savings due to reduced heating
needs, increased cooling demand will lead to large increases in many areas of the tropics.</p>
<p>Within the United States, I find that rural
areas will be hard-hit. My co-author and I estimate that with a high emissions scenario 18 , rising
temperatures will reduce 2050 corn acreage by 94% and soybean acreage by 98% when
compared to levels in 2002. The lost corn and soybean production will not be replaced by
increased production of any crop currently grown in the US: as returns to agriculture decline in
connection with climate change, farmers will seek to shift land use toward different crops and
non-agricultural options. It will effectively bring an end to the more than 150-year tradition of
farming as we know it in the US corn-belt that encompasses great swatches of Iowa, Nebraska,
and Illinois.</p>
<p>The uneven distribution of climate damages means that the very mitigation of climate change is a
pursuit of environmental justice.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.1.2</span> Greenstone Estimating SCC (MIT CEEPR WP 2011-006):*</h3>
<p>For 2010, the central value of the
SCC is $21 per ton of CO 2 emissions and sensitivity analyses are to be conducted
at $5, $35, and $65 (2007$). This paper summarizes the methodology and
process used to develop the SCC values.</p>
<p>The 2009-2010 interagency process that developed these SCC values was the first U.S. federal
government effort to promote consistency in the way that agencies calculate the social benefits of
reducing CO 2 emissions in regulatory impact analyses. 4 Prior to 2008, reductions in CO 2
emissions were not valued in federal benefit–cost analyses.</p>
<p><em>IAMs</em></p>
<p>Analysts face a number of significant challenges when attempting to quantify the economic
impacts of CO 2 emissions. In particular, analysts must make assumptions about four main steps
of the estimation process: (1) the future emissions of greenhouse gases; (2) the effects of past and
future emissions on the climate system; (3) the impact of changes in climate on the physical and
biological environment; and, (4) the translation of these environmental impacts into economic
damages. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been developed to combine these steps
into a single modeling framework; the word “integrated” refers to the fact that they integrate
knowledge from science and economics. However, they gain this advantage at the expense of a
more detailed representation of the underlying climatic and economic systems.</p>
<p>The IAMs translate emissions into changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations,
atmospheric concentrations into changes in temperature, and changes in temperature into
economic damages.</p>
<p>The emissions projections used in the models are based on specified socio-
economic (GDP and population) pathways. These emissions are translated into concentrations
using the carbon cycle built into each model, and concentrations are translated into warming
based on each model’s simplified representation of the climate and a key parameter, climate
sensitivity. Finally, transforming the stream of economic damages over time into a single value
requires judgments about how to discount them.</p>
<p>(DICE-PAGE-FUND differences discussed in paper omitted here)</p>
<p>Overall, the power of the IAMs is that they offer guidance to the incredibly complex question of
what an extra ton of greenhouse damages will do to human wellbeing. This is no small task and
this is what makes them so appealing. However, the results are highly dependent on a series of
assumptions that cannot easily be verified.</p>
<p>On Discount Rates:</p>
<p><em>Historically Observed Interest Rates</em></p>
<p><em>Ramsey Equation</em></p>
<p>Ramsey discounting also provides a useful framework to inform the choice of a discount rate.
Under this approach, the analyst applies either positive or normative judgments in selecting
values for the key parameters of the Ramsey equation: η (coefficient of relative risk aversion or
elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption) and ρ (pure rate of time preference). 18 These
are then combined with g (growth rate of per-capita consumption) to equal the interest rate at
which future monetized damages are discounted: ρ + η·g.</p>
<p>Most papers in the climate change literature adopt values for η in the range of 0.5 to 3, although
not all authors articulate whether their choice is based on prescriptive or descriptive reasoning. 19
Dasgupta (2008) argues that η should be greater than 1 and may be as high as 3, since η equal to
1 suggests savings rates that do not conform to observed behavior. With respect to the pure rate
of time preference, most papers in the climate change literature adopt values for ρ in the range of
0 to 3 percent per year. The very low rates tend to follow from moral judgments involving
intergenerational neutrality. Some have argued that to use any value other than ρ = 0 would
unjustly discriminate against future generations (e.g., Arrow et al. 1996, Stern et al. 2006).
However, even in an inter-generational setting, it may make sense to use a small positive pure
rate of time preference because of the small probability of unforeseen cataclysmic events (Stern
et al. 2006).</p>
<p>Some economists and non-economists have argued for constant discount rates below 2 percent
based on the prescriptive approach. When grounded in the Ramsey framework, proponents of
this approach have argued that a ρ of zero avoids giving preferential treatment to one generation
over another. The choice of η has also been posed as an ethical choice linked to the value of an
additional dollar in poorer countries compared to wealthier ones. Stern et al. (2006) applies this
perspective through his choice of ρ = 0.1 percent per year η = 1, yielding an annual discount rate
of 1.4 percent when combined with the growth rate. Recently, Stern (2008) revisited the values
used in Stern et al. (2006), stating that there is a case to be made for raising η due to the amount
of weight lower values place on damages far in the future (over 90 percent of expected damages
occur after 2200 with η = 1).</p>
<p>If there is a persistent element to the uncertainty in the discount rate (e.g., the
rate follows a random walk), then it will result in an effective (or certainty-equivalent) discount
rate that declines over time. Consequently, lower discount rates tend to dominate over the very
long term</p>
<p><em>Updating 2021 - $125 - Abstract</em></p>
<p>This paper outlines a two-step process to return the United States government’s
Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to the frontier of economics and climate science.
The first step is to implement the original 2009-2010 Inter-agency Working
Group (IWG) framework using a discount rate of 2%. This can be done
immediately and will result in an SCC for 2020 of $125. The second step is to
reconvene a new IWG tasked with comprehensively updating the SCC over the
course of several months that would involve the integration of multiple recent
advances in economics and science. We detail these advances here and provide
recommendations on their integration into a new SCC estimation framework.</p>

<div id="greenstone-updating-scc" class="section level3" number="28.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.1.3</span> Greenstone: Updating SCC</h3>
<p>In many respects, the SCC is the “straw that stirs the drink” for most domestic climate
policies, determining in some cases whether or not regulatory action can proceed.</p>
<p>A defining feature of the best new (after 2010) research is that it relies on large-scale data
sets, rather than assumptions that are often unverifiable.</p>
<p>New estimates for two of three recently studied SCC
sectors (mortality and agriculture) indicate substantially larger damages from CO 2 ,
suggesting that the SCC, as settled in 2013, is too low.
Climate change is projected to disproportionately
harm today’s poorest populations, exacerbating concerns about environmental justice.</p>
<p>The Biden administration can initiate the first step immediately
and simply involves implementing the IWG’s approach again with a discount rate of no
higher than 2 percent, which reflects profound changes in international capital markets
that make the current values difficult to justify. At a discount rate of 2% the SCC in
2020 is $125.</p>
<p>There are seven “ingredients” necessary to construct the SCC. The first four are often
referred to as “modules” :</p>
<pre><code>1. A socioeconomic and emissions trajectory, which predicts how the global  
economy and CO 2 emissions will grow in the future;  
2. A climate module, which measures the effect of emissions on the climate;  
3. A damages module, which translates changes in climate to economic  
damages; and  
4. A discounting module, which calculates the present value of future  
damages.  </code></pre>
<p>In addition, there are three cross-cutting modeling decisions
that affect the entire process:</p>
<pre><code>1. Whether to include global or instead only domestic climate damages;  
2. How to value uncertainty; and  
3. How to treat equity.  </code></pre>
<p><img src="fig/scc_steps.png" /></p>
<p>DICE, FUND, and PAGE substantially
underestimate the speed of temperature increase, relative to climate models that satisfy
the NAS criteria for meeting scientific standards (Figure 4). 17 For example, higher
atmospheric CO 2 concentrations cause the oceans to warm and acidify, which makes
them less effective at removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. The consequence is a positive
feedback loop that accelerates warming. 18 However, this dynamic is missing from both
the DICE and PAGE climate modules.
The delayed projection
of warming in the IAMs’ climate models means that resulting estimates of the SCC are
likely to be too low. The delay pushes warming further into the future, which is
discounted more heavily.</p>
<p>A simple Earth system model that can conduct uncertainty analysis while also
matching predictions from these more complex models is necessary. (FAIR)</p>
<p>A key limitation of FAIR and other simple climate models is that they do not represent
the change in global mean sea level rise (GMSL) due to a marginal change in emissions.
However, statistical methods can be used in combination with long historical records of
both temperature and sea level to build a semi-empirical model of the relationship
between GMSL and GMST. 25 Such models are readily available 26 and can enable the
inclusion of marginal damages due both to warming and to projected changes in sea
level. An important potential caveat is that available semi-empirical models of GMSL,
in addition to more complex bottom-up models, may underestimate future sea level rise
due to their inability to capture plausible future dynamics that are not observed in the
historical record (e.g., ice cliff collapse).</p>
<p>At least two problems have plagued the IAM damage functions. First, they are
primarily derived from ad-hoc assumptions and simplified relationships, not large-scale
empirical evidence. Further, the IAM damage functions have tended to treat the world
as nearly homogeneous, dividing the globe into at most sixteen regions. This aggregation
misses a great deal, especially because there are important nonlinearities in the
relationship between temperature and human well-being that are obscured by
substantial aggregation.</p>
<p>The damage functions from FUND, DICE, and PAGE used by the IWG do not
meet this criterion. They are only loosely calibrated to empirical evidence and/or
rely on outdated estimates that fail to isolate the role of changes in the climate
from economic variables such as income and institutions. For example, the
majority of the studies used in FUND’s sector-specific damage functions were
published prior to 2000, and all likely suffer from the influence of unobserved
factors that are correlated with temperature. Similarly, early versions of DICE
utilized a damage function that was only loosely tied to empirical literature (Diaz
and Moore, 2017; Nordhaus, 2010), while the recent DICE update continues to
rely on empirical papers that fail to identify plausibly causal effects (Nordhaus
and Moffat, 2017).</p>
<p>Dramatic reductions in computing costs and increased data availability have
enabled researchers to identify the effects of climate change on social and
economic conditions at local scale across the globe. This body of work has
uncovered that many socioeconomic outcomes display a strongly nonlinear
relationship with climate variables.</p>
<p>The existing IAMs’ damage functions fail to adequately characterize
nonlinearities, to disaggregate local impacts around the world, or to include
information from lower-income, hotter regions of the globe.</p>
<p>Overturned past findings that suggested that
climate change would benefit agriculture, instead finding that it would cause substantial
damage.</p>
<p>Along with a set of socioeconomic and emissions scenarios, discussed below,
the climate and damages modules together translate a single additional ton of CO2
emissions into a trajectory of additional warming, and a stream of future damages. The
final step in the SCC calculation is to express this stream of damages as a single present
value, so that future costs and benefits can be directly compared to costs and benefits of
actions taken today.</p>
<p>!!
There are two reasons for “discounting the future,” or more precisely for discounting
future monetary amounts, whether benefits or costs. The first is that an additional
dollar is worth more to a poor person than a wealthy one, which is referred to in
technical terms as the declining marginal value of consumption. The relevance for the
SCC is that damages from climate change that occur in the future will matter less to
society than those that occur today, because societies will be wealthier. The second,
which is debated more vigorously, is the pure rate of time preference: people value the
future less than the present, regardless of income levels. While individuals may
undervalue the future because of the possibility that they will no longer be alive, it is
unclear how to apply such logic to society as a whole facing centuries of climate change.
Perhaps the most compelling explanation for a nonzero pure rate of time preference is
the possibility of a disaster (e.g., asteroids or nuclear war) that wipes out the population
at some point in the future, thus removing the value of any events that happen
afterwards.</p>
<p>!!
U.S. government agencies have relied on the Office of Management and
Budget’s (OMB’s) guidance to federal agencies on the development of regulatory
analysis in Circular A-4, and used 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates in cost-benefit
analysis. 61 These two values are justified based on observed market rates of return,
which can be used to infer the discount rate for the SCC since any expenditures
incurred today to mitigate CO 2 emissions must be financed just like any other
investment. The 3 percent discount rate is a proxy for the real, after-tax riskless interest
rate associated with U.S. government bonds and the 7 percent rate is intended to reflect
real equity returns like those in the stock market. However, climate change involves
intergenerational tradeoffs, raising difficult scientific, philosophical and legal questions
regarding equity across long periods of time. There is no scientific consensus about the
correct approach to discounting for the SCC.</p>
<p>The assumption that climate damages were projected to be uncorrelated with overall market
returns (eliminating the 7 percent rate, derived from equity markets) and thus used
insights from asset pricing theory that the riskless interest rate was appropriate.</p>
<p>The equilibrium real interest rate has declined substantially since the 1990s,
suggesting a lower discount rate is justified. 65 Additionally, evidence from long-term real
estate investments suggests that for climate mitigation, which has payoffs over very long
periods of time, discount rates should be even lower than those used to discount costs
and benefits of shorter-lived investments. 66 Overall, our judgement is that it is difficult
to defend a 3 percent discount rate for climate investments and there is now a
compelling case for a riskless discount rate of no higher than 2 percent.</p>
<p>!!
There is also the possibility, however, that the riskless rate itself is not appropriate as
the central discount rate due to the unique risk properties of climate change and
uncertainty about future interest rates. Because discount rates reflect the returns to
investments that mitigate climate change, Americans are best served by using an
interest rate associated with investments that match the structure of payoffs from
climate mitigation. Capital asset pricing models recommend low discount rates in
scenarios where investments (in this case CO 2 mitigation) pay off in “bad” states of the
world—that is, if climate damages are likely to coincide with a slowing overall economic
growth rate that for example could be due “tipping points” or large-scale human
responses to climate change, including mass migration. 68 If on the other hand climate
damages act as tax on the economy (i.e., total damages are larger when the economy
grows faster), then higher discount rates like the average return in equity markets would
be merited.</p>
<p><em>Ramsey</em>
A second potential approach to deriving a discount rate is to explicitly account for
future economic growth using the so-called Ramsey equation, 69 which is often referred to
as the prescriptive approach. This approach has been recommended by the NAS as a
“feasible and conceptually sound framework.” Rather than rely on observed
interest rates, it derives a discount rate from assumptions about three parameters: the
pure rate of time preference, the growth rate of consumption, and a parameter capturing
the decreasing marginal utility of consumption. Values for the first and third parameters
have been estimated in a large literature, while the consumption growth rate will depend
on the set of socioeconomic scenarios developed in the socioeconomic and emissions
module described above. 70
The Ramsey approach has two key limitations. First, future economic growth is
uncertain, while the Ramsey equation is deterministic. Second, climate damages are
likely to be the highest in possible future scenarios where economic growth is the lowest.
Both facts imply that climate mitigation policies act as a form of insurance for the
future and imply a lower discount rate than is given by the Ramsey equation. Besides
these limitations, some find it unappealing that the Ramsey approach requires several
judgments by “experts” about the value of key parameters, rather than relying on
observed market interest rates.</p>
<p><em>Socioeconomic and Emissions Module</em>
To calculate the SCC, it is necessary to compare a baseline trajectory of
economic growth and CO 2 emissions to a trajectory in which one more ton of CO 2 is
released. All else equal, a higher baseline CO 2 emissions trajectory will result in a
greater SCC, because projected climate change damages are nonlinear; that is, an
additional ton of CO 2 emissions is projected to cause more damages at higher
atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 .
Baseline economic growth affects the SCC in a
variety of competing ways. Richer economies consume more energy and generate higher
emissions, such that marginal tons do more damage and populations have higher
willingness-to-pay to avoid climate change, which increases the SCC.</p>
<p><em>Uncertainty</em>
In the last decade, advances in
computing have enabled probabilistic climate change projections that capture multiple
measures of uncertainty about the magnitude of climate damages. Thus, for the first
time, it is possible to characterize these uncertainties and to incorporate them into the
calculation of the SCC.
Accounting for this uncertainty when individuals are modeled as risk averse can
substantially increase the SCC.</p>
<p><em>Equity</em>
An additional dollar is worth more to a poor person than a wealthy one.
Applying this principle to the SCC would require “equity weighting.”
This logic would mean
that damages occurring in poor countries are weighted more highly than damages in
wealthy countries.
The same logic that justifies discounting and the valuation of uncertainty over
future states of the world implies that equity weights should be applied in any SCC
calculation; declining marginal value of consumption is the fundamental economic
concept behind all three concerns. Therefore, the most intellectually coherent approach
to treating equity would be to calibrate equity weights from the large literature studying
the marginal value of consumption, and to apply these weights at the spatial resolution
of damages.</p>
<p>This pathway (C) is based on the recognition that a simple economic principle—declining
marginal value of consumption—underlies the motivation for discounting as well as the
valuation of both equity and uncertainty. 100 This principle is based on the
straightforward observation that $100 is worth more to a person living in poverty than a
wealthy person. In the climate setting, declining marginal value implies that one should
attach a higher value to future and present impacts of climate change when they occur
to populations experiencing lower incomes. It also means that when future incomes are
uncertain, one has to account for the risk of severe damages occurring when average
global income is very low, and thus when the value of an additional dollar is relatively
high.</p>
<p>Therefore, an argument can be made for computing an SCC in which the damage
function represents the difference in the “certainty-equivalent” value of consumption
across all years, populations, and possible future states of the world with and without
climate change. 102 In this approach, the valuation of climate damages is conducted from
the perspective of a person who does not know their circumstances in advance, so they
account for all potential income levels and degrees of climate risk they might face.</p>
<p>Under this approach, discounting, uncertainty valuation, and accounting for equity
implications are all incorporated into the construction of a single, certainty-equivalent
damage function.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.2</span> Current Prices far below SCC</h2>
<p>The vast majority of carbon prices are
well below even the most conservative estimates of the “social cost of carbon” (SCC).
The SCC internalizes the environmental and health effects of greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study
surveyed environmental experts on their estimation of SCC, which ranged between $80 and
$300 per ton (Pindyck, 2019). Another study estimates a global median price of $417, with
substantial national level variation (Ricke et al., 2018) A more conservative estimate puts the
SCC between $50-$100 by 2030 (Carbon Pricing Leadership Commission, 2017).
Even compared to the most conservative estimates of the SCC, carbon pricing falls short. The
most recent World Bank survey of carbon pricing shows that half of the 61 carbon pricing
policies around the globe have a price lower than $10. The IMF estimates that the average
global price for carbon is $2/ton (Parry, 2019).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.3</span> Stern Stiglitz Alternative Approach</h2>
<p><em>A Catalogue of all that is wrong with IAMs</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p>Designing policy for climate change requires analyses which integrate the interrelationship
between the economy and environment, including: the immense risks and impacts on distribution
across and within generations; the many failures, limitations or absences of key markets; and the
limitations on government, both in offsetting these failures and distributional impacts. Much of
the standard economic modelling, including Integrated Assessment Models, does not embody key
aspects of these essentials. We identify fundamental flaws in both the descriptive and normative
methodologies commonly used to assess climate policy, showing systematic biases, with costs of
climate action overestimated and benefits underestimated. We provide an alternative
methodology by which the social cost of carbon may be calculated, one which embraces the
essential elements we have identified.</p>
<p><strong>Memo</strong></p>
<p><em>Ambition</em></p>
<p>The idea of integrating economics and the environment makes eminent sense, but the devil
is in the details. The fact that the overwhelming consensus in the international community,
including the scientific community, differs so markedly from the results of the IAMs raises a
key question: is it sloppy thinking, perhaps an excess of compassion for the species that
may be extinguished as climate change proceeds apace to the 3.5 to 4 degree
“recommended” by the IAMs, that has led the international community to irrationally
embrace a goal involving excessive costs from the perspective of a hard-headed analysis of
society welfare maximization; or is it that the IAMs have left something—or many things—
out of their analysis? Or is their whole conceptual apparatus so deeply flawed as to give us
little guidance either for the calculation of SCC or the level of climate change that should be
acceptable? The objective of this paper is to answer that question, and in doing so, to
formulate another approach, which better reflects the risks, the distributive effects, and the
market failures that are integral to the analysis of climate change.</p>
<p><em>Varia</em></p>
<p>Capital markets do not represent moral valuations across individuals.</p>
<p>The key assumption within IAMs, showing how they all, on
damages, on technology, on values and preferences, in the treatment of risk, distribution,
and other market failures, tilt conclusions away from strong action on climate change and
towards a low social cost of carbon.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>The paper provides a path towards the reconciliation between the perspectives of the
broader scientific community, which has pushed for urgent and strong action (IPCC, 2018;
Ripple et al., 2020) and a part of the economics community, using particular versions of
Integrated Assessment Models, who have been skeptical of the need for such urgent action
and have not only been tolerant of, but urged the acceptance, of higher levels of climate
change. The intuitions of the scientific community may well be right: the simplistic models
of the economists have simply not captured essential aspects of the societal decision
problem, and when they do so, the disparities in perspectives may be closed, if not
eliminated.</p>
